## MCP Response Envelope

Every MPS MCP tool returns a JSON envelope at the top level:

```
{
  "ok": true | false,
  "data": <payload>,         // present on ok:true; type depends on the tool
  "warnings": ["..."],       // optional; present only when non-empty
  "details": { ... },        // optional; present only when non-empty
  "error": "...",            // present on ok:false
  "code": "ERROR_CODE"       // present on ok:false when a structured error code is available
}
```

**`warnings`** appear in the envelope on a **successful response** (`ok:true`) when the tool completed but found something worth surfacing without treating it as an error. Current producers:

- **`mps_mcp_get_concept_details` partial success**: one warning per unresolved ref, alongside `details.unresolved` with suggestions.
- **Dry-run validation of node blueprints** (`mps_mcp_update_node`, `mps_mcp_insert_root_node_from_json`, `mps_mcp_update_root_node_from_json`): a warning is added when a reference target did not resolve during staging and the production write *would* create a dynamic (unresolved) reference. The dry-run itself succeeds, but the warning signals that the subsequent write may produce a broken reference.

**Dry-run response** specifically:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": { "dryRun": true, "message": "Dry run successful for ..." },
  "warnings": ["Dry run at $.references[0]: target 'X' did not resolve; production run would create a dynamic reference, but dry-run skips this step."]
}
```

Always inspect `warnings` after a dry-run response — an empty `warnings` list means staging was clean; a non-empty list means the production write will produce dynamic references for the listed targets.
